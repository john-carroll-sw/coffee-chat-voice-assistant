# To-Do List

## Must

<!-- - TODO Change show history button text -->
<!-- - TODO Have Chat History Panel show who is speaking -->
<!-- - TODO Chat History, Align user right and assistant left, color -->
<!-- - TODO Chat History, have it keep up to the bottom always. -->
<!-- - TODO grounding in the history, help it show up correctly in the chat history. Consider removing it from the normal area when chat history is shown -->
<!-- - TODO increase the silence duration, edit the sensitivity -->
<!-- - TODO Get search tool up and running with realtime -->
<!-- - TODO Add UI elements to show the menu -->
<!-- - TODO Add UI elements to show the order -->
<!-- - TODO Add in the toggle-able elements to switch to the STT-LLM-TTS services pipeline to compare the latency, phonetics, conversable AI experiences -->
<!-- - TODO Update Azure AI Search index to be on the menuItems.json -->
<!-- - TODO Order Summary: Implement some sort of order state management, complete with price calculations. Needs to utilize function calling with the LLM. -->
<!-- - TODO Order Summary: Implement a way to provide the current order summary to the model. Maybe after each order update there is a call to the server after maybe four seconds to send to the server the order summary. -->
<!-- - TODO Move to its own github: voice assistant coffee chat -->
- TODO Move state management of order to the front-end, this may mean that the tools calls related to the order, meaning updates and the order summary need to be on the frontend vs backend
- TODO Build out the Azure Backend Toggle to switch from the Realtime API to the STT-LLM-TTS services pipeline to compare the latency, phonetics, conversable AI experiences
- TODO Deploy it
- TODO Add in tokens for session; research audio tokenizer from openai if it is openly available
- TODO Add in Azure AI Speech Backend

## Should

<!-- - TODO Add PDF view in a left side panel for all files that are grounded on -->

## Could

- TODO Could add a 'Show me what this drink looks like' feature, which upon user request, the application would pop up an image of the menu item.
- TODO Could add in Bing API for searching latest info on the web
- TODO Create audio actions/tools/functions to open and close chat history as well as show menu

## Would

<!-- - TODO Add timestamp (7:10 AM in the middle, small) if a message hasn't been added in a few minutes.  -->
<!-- - TODO Add a dark theme -->
- TODO Consider adding a chat box to the bottom of Chat History. This would make it Chat, instead of Chat History
